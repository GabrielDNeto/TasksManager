# TasksManager

### AdonisJS 5 Web Application

ðŸš€ This is my first project with AdonisJS, a very simple tasks manager wich you can create, list, update, delete tasks and can organize those in the panels with a drag-n-drop functionality.

I'm using a very simple login system too, with web guard authentication, you can see the credentials into the user seeder.


##### Hope you enjoy it! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
